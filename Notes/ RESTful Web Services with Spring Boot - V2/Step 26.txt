 Step 26 - Exploring APIs with Spring Boot HAL Explorer
 -----------------------------------------------------------

HAL stands for Jason Hypertext Application Language.
It's a simple format that gives a consistent and easy way to hyperlink between resources in our API.
Earlier, we enhanced our GET request users/{id} a specific user API to return a link to all users. The format which we are making use of in here is HAL format. So we have _links inside which, all our links are defined.



HAL Explorer is an API explorer for restful Hypermedia APIs, which are using HAL.
If your APIs are using HAL then you can use HAL Explorer to explore your APIs. The biggest advantage of using HAL Explorer is
that it enables your non-technical teams also to play with your APIs.
Spring Boot, HAL Explorer Auto configures HAL Explorer for Spring Boot Projects.
So if you want to use HAL Explorer in your Spring boot projects, the easiest way to do that is by using Spring Boot HAL Explorer.
