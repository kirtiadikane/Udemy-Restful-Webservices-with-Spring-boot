Add H2 config details in application.properties file.

URL to access H2 DB- http://localhost:8080/h2-console
Add jdbc:h2:mem:testdb in the url

When I save this, I see an error saying, "Table 'user_details' is not found." So, the data.SQL is getting executed before our tables are created in H2 database. 
And we want to delay that. That is why we are going to use a property, "spring.jpa.defer-datasource-initialization=true".
So, we want to defer the initialization of datasource the execution of data SQL.
